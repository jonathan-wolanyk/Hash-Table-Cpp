# Hash-Table-Cpp

<h3><strong>What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</h3></strong>
  <p>Across the various data structures I created in this course, I was solving the problem of storing and accessing data given from a theoretical school. The school hoped to pass in CSV files to the program. The program would load the data into a given data structure before allowing users to access or remove objects from the structure. In order to successfully complete the project requirements, the CSV data must be loaded into the data structure (this repository houses the Hash Table data structure) and formatted to account for the course ID, title, and prerequisites.</p>
  
<h3><strong>How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</h3></strong>
  <p> I approached the problem by reviewing similar work I had done earlier in the course using a hash table. The earlier project loaded data from excel spreadsheets into a given data structure, formatted the data, and allowed users to access objects within the data structure. I implemented similar elements from the previous project to construct the project housed in this repository.</p>
  
<h3><strong>How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</h3></strong>
  <p>To overcome roadblocks I encountered during the project, I utilized Stack Overflow and W3Schools to gain a better understanding of how others construct hash tables and access elements within such tables.</p>
  
<h3><strong>How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</h3></strong>
  <p>My time spent learning more about hash tables, binary trees, and vectors allowed me to gain a better understanding of which situations warrant specific data structures. For instance, hash tables are useful because one can check if a key is already stored quickly, as well as store information rapidly.</p>
  
<h3><strong>How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h3></strong>
  <p>Throughout my work in this course and project, I have honed my commenting practices to be more concise and descriptive. Effective commenting of code is essential to continuous work on a project as well as updates to the project in the future.</p>
